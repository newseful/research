# Research on events from Summer-Fall of 2014 in Ferguson MO

## List of rumors and disputed facts
- Orbital fracture of Darren Wilson/exaggerated injury reports of Darren Wilson
- Gunpowder residue not found on Brown's clothing
- Michael Brown libel (drug dealer, gang member, etc.)
- Michael Brown education plans re: technical college
- Hands up, "don't shoot" rumors
- Gun went off in the car
- Brown was reaching for Wilson's gun through window of car
- Brown charged Wilson before being shot
- Varying reports of level of violence in protests
- Varying reports of Grand Jury composition
- w/r/t orbital fracture of Darren Wilson: 
- "The orgin of the misreporting can be attributed to a Conservative St Louis blogger who said he heard a rumor that Wilson had an orbital fracture. It is looking more and more like the blogger heard the rumor on a Conservative local radio show hosted by a notoriously slanted conservative host who had an ANONYMOUS caller tell him she heard from a friend of Wilson that he was beaten by Brown and received a fracture."
- Eventually on social media there was a photograph circulating claiming to be an X-Ray of Wilson's injury, it was, of course, not Wilson.
- Never confirmed by any law enforcement agency or anything close to authoritative
- w/r/t gunpowder residue on clothing of Michael Brown: reported as no residue indicating shooting distance of more than 20ft, but the truth of the matter was that the clothes were never examined, body only (which had no residue)
